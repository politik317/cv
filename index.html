      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>ARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS was born on April 26, A.D. 121. His real name
      was M. Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which claimed
      descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most religious of
      emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings. His father,
      Annius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of
      the same name, had been thrice Consul.</p></td>
